Hello and welcome! I'm Ogochukwu Ozotta, a DevOps and Site Reliability Engineer passionate about Cloud Computing, DevOps, Data Engineering, and Machine Learning. This blog is where I share insights, tutorials, and discussions on these topics, combining practical knowledge with real-world experiences.

## Topics I Cover
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Strategies and best practices for AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- **DevOps Automation**: Building efficient CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code (using tools like Terraform and Ansible), and container orchestration with Kubernetes.
- **Data Science & MLOps**: Cloud-based AI solutions, automated data workflows, and scaling machine learning models with MLOps.
- **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**: Ensuring reliability, scalability, and high availability in cloud-native environments.

## Highlights
### DevOps, Cloud, and Automation
Drawing from years of hands-on experience, I create content on:
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Streamlining software delivery using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Azure DevOps.
- **Containerization and Orchestration**: Best practices for Docker, Kubernetes, Helm charts, and service meshes like Istio.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Practical guides on automating cloud infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible.

### Data Science & MLOps
I also explore the intersection of data science and operations:
- **MLOps**: Automating data workflows, building scalable ML pipelines, and integrating data engineering for improved performance.
- **Cloud-based Data Solutions**: Using AWS tools like Lambda, Glue, and Kubernetes for reliable data pipelines.

## About Me
I hold a PhD in Petroleum Engineering and have diverse experience across cloud computing, infrastructure engineering, and software development. My professional journey includes roles in academia, fintech, energy, and large-scale cloud infrastructure for enterprises. In my current role as a **DevOps | SRE**, I focus on ensuring availability and reliability for cloud-native applications through advanced DevOps methodologies.

### Professional Experience
